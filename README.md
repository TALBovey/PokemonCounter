Hello and welcome to my Pokemon Counter App!

This is purely just built for myself to have a personal counter and side project to have while I hunt shiny pokemon!

Feel free to download for your own use or to tweak it however you want!

Features to add:
Add method odds to show your updated odds based on your hunting method

Maybe add pokeball to main screen and catch rate calculator
